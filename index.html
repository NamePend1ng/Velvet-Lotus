<h2>Frequently Asked Questions<br></h2>
</header>
<p class=lead>1. Do you do piercings?<br>
No. Thanks for inquiring if we can help you with a tattoo down the line please visit us at www.velvetlotustattoo.com. <br><br>
2. What are your hours?<br>
We are typically at the studio Tuesday-Saturday noon to 6pm. Sometimes later. Please give us a call or come by to check availability.
<br><br>
3. Do you take walk ins?<br>
Yes. We take walkins when available and appropriate. Please give us a call or come by to check availability.<br><br>
4. How do I get an appointment?<br>
    Each artist does their own scheduling. You can visit www.velvetlotustattoo.com and click on appointment requests. Here you can find the information the artist will need as well as their email addresses. Just email the required information to the artist you would like to work with and they will aim to get back to you as soon as possible. They can also address any other questions you may have.<br><br>
5. How much does a tattoo cost? Why do you not do pricing over the phone?<br>
Our tattoos start at $80 and go up from there. Larger designs, such as those bigger than a sheet of paper or so, are priced at an hourly rate of 120-150 an hour. Many factors are considered in pricing a tattoo such as size, detail, location and amount of color.<br><br>
6. Do tattoos hurt?<br>
Pain is relative. We all feel it differently. There is a discomfort that is more irritating and annoying than painful. While described many ways, it is kinda like a cat scratch on a sunburn. <br><br>
7. How old do you have to be to get tattooed?<br>
Iowa State law requires you to be 18 years of age with a valid, government issued ID such as a drivers license, non-drivers license, passport or military ID. There is NO parental consent allowed in this state. <br><br>
8. Do you use new needles on each client?<br>
YES! Each tattoo is applied with new, sterile needles and tubes. The pigment is poured in individual ink caps. Ointments are single use. All is disposed of after each client.<br><br>
9. Are you State licensed?<br>
Yes. You can find licensed studios and artists online at www.idph.iowa.gov and typing tattoo establishment directory or tattoo artist directory in the search bar. Our permit is visibly seen at the studio as well as each artists permit. Once a year we are inspected by the health department and must have our inspection checklist posted for viewing at the studio. <br><br>
10. What type of tattoos do you do?<br>
We like to custom design tattoos for our clients via a sit-down (consultation) appointment. We do everything from flowers to animals, geometric, to traditional. If your idea is not applicable to be translated to a tattoo we can educate you to what can work and still get across your idea. We want you to have a long lasting, legible tattoo for years to come. <br> <br>
11. How long have you been in business and how much experience do your artists have?<br>
Velvet Lotus Tattoo opened in August of 2013. Our artists have a combined experience of over 20 years. For more information on our artists visit www.velvetlotustattoo.com and click on the artist page. <br><br>
12. How long does it take for a tattoo to heal?<br>
On average, 7-14 days for the initial healing flaking to subside. The underneath layers of skin can take anywhere in the month or so range. <br> <br>
13. Do you do touch-ups?<br>
Each artist will touch up work if necessary as long as you have followed all the care instructions given at the appointment. The touch up is at no charge. Feet, hands and fingers are an exception and may require a nominal set up fee. This is discussed prior to doing hand or feet tattoos. <br><br>
14. Do you do permanent makeup/cosmetics?<br>
No. Thank you for your interest. If we can help you with a tattoo down the line, let us know.
<br><br>
15. Which artist would be best for my project/tattoo idea?<br>
Choosing an artist is really a personal decision. Please visit www.velvetlotustattoo.com to view each artists work. Reading their bios to get an idea of their personality may be helpful to you as well. <br><br>
16. Why do you require a deposit to secure an appointment?<br>
The deposit helps compensate for our time. To secure an appointment, an $80 <bold>(NON REFUNDABLE)</bold> deposit is taken in person, over the phone, via Venmo or via PayPal. The deposit will come off the total price of the tattoo. Please provide us a 48 hour notice if needing to reschedule, and you can move your appointment to another time without losing your deposit. </p>

<h2>Michelle Balhan</h2><h3>Books Closed until 1/23/22</h3><hr>
<p>Michelle Balhan describes herself as a versatile tattooist with a passion for exploring all styles of my craft. Born in Chicago suburbs with a touch of the crazies, Michelle became involved in the tattoo industry during the year of 1993 and began tattooing in 1996. A pleaser by nature, her love of tattooing allows her to make the customer happy working on a design they present to her or by creating something based upon the customer's ideas and inspirations. Inspired by a communal rhythm that moves through the universe and creates a connectedness between humanity and nature, she brings a sense of flow and balance to her designs. Vivid color is dominant in her work reflecting the colorful personalities she meets on a regular basis. She welcomes the challenge to create unique tattoos which express emotion and mark moments in the life of her clients. Outside of tattooing, Michelle tries her hand at painting, loves to travel but mostly enjoys spending time with family and friends conversing about life's joys and obstacles.</p><br><br>
